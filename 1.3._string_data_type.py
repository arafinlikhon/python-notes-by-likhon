        Python String Topic Note
-----------------------------------------

1. Introduction to Strings:

    - In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
    - Strings are immutable, meaning you can't change their individual characters once they're created.

2. String Declaration and Assignment:

    - You can declare and assign strings easily:
    
    my_string = "Hello, Python!"
    
    - Escape sequences like '\\n' for newline or '\\t' for tab can be used within strings.

3. String Concatenation:

    - You can concatenate strings using the '+' operator:
    
    first_name = "John"
    last_name = "Doe"
    full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

4. String Indexing and Slicing:

    - Strings are indexed from 0, with negative indexing starting from -1.
    
    my_string = "Python"
    first_char = my_string[0]  # 'P'
    last_char = my_string[-1]  # 'n'
    
    - Slicing allows you to extract substrings:
    
    sub_string = my_string[2:5]  # 'tho'

5. String Methods:

    - Python provides a variety of built-in string methods for manipulation:
    
    - `len(my_string)` returns the length of the string.
    - `my_string.lower()` converts the string to lowercase.
    - `my_string.upper()` converts the string to uppercase.
    - `my_string.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace.
    - `my_string.replace(old, new)` replaces occurrences of 'old' with 'new'.
    - `my_string.split(delimiter)` splits the string into a list using 'delimiter'.
    
6. String Formatting:

    - You can format strings using f-strings:
    
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

7. String Concatenation vs. Joining:

    - For concatenating multiple strings, '+' is used, but for joining elements in an iterable, `join()` method is preferred for efficiency.

    words = ["Hello", "World"]
    joined_string = " ".join(words)  # 'Hello World'

8. Escape Sequences:

    - Escape sequences are used to include special characters in strings, like '\\n' for a newline or '\\t' for a tab.

9. Raw Strings:

    - Raw strings can be created using 'r' or 'R' prefix, which treats escape sequences as literal characters.

    raw_string = r'C:\Users\Documents'
