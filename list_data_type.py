        Python List Topic Note
-----------------------------------------

1. Introduction to Lists:

    - In Python, a list is a collection of ordered and mutable elements enclosed in square brackets ([]).
    - Lists can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, or even other lists.

2. Declaration and Initialization:

    - You can declare and initialize lists easily:
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    
3. Accessing List Elements:

    - Lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0:
    
    first_element = numbers[0]  # 1
    last_element = fruits[-1]   # "cherry"
    
4. List Slicing:

    - You can extract sublists using slicing:
    
    sub_list = numbers[1:4]  # [2, 3, 4]
    
5. Modifying Lists:

    - Lists are mutable, so you can change their elements:
    
    fruits[1] = "orange"  # Modifies "banana" to "orange"
    
6. List Methods:

    - Python provides various built-in methods for list manipulation:
    
    - `append()`: Adds an element to the end of the list.
    - `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specific index.
    - `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
    - `pop()`: Removes and returns an element by index.
    - `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
    - `reverse()`: Reverses the order of elements.
    - `len()`: Returns the length of the list.
    
7. List Comprehensions:

    - List comprehensions offer a concise way to create lists based on existing ones:
    
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    
8. Nested Lists:

    - Lists can contain other lists, creating nested structures:
    
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    
9. Common List Operations:

    - You can perform common operations like concatenation and repetition on lists:
    
    combined_list = numbers + fruits
    repeated_list = numbers * 3
