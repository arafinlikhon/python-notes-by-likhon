   Variables and Data Types in Python
-----------------------------------------

In Python, variables are like containers used to store data or values. Each variable has a name and a data type associated with it. Let's explore the essentials of variables and the common data types in Python.

1. Variable Declaration:
   - You declare variables to assign values to them. For example:
   
   age = 25
   name = "John"

2. Variable Naming Rules:
   - Follow these rules when naming variables:
     1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
     2. The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
     3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar is different from myvar).

3. Data Types:
   - Python offers various built-in data types, including:
     1. int: For integer values (e.g., 42).
     2. float: For floating-point numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14).
     3. str: For strings of text (e.g., "Hello, World!").
     4. bool: For Boolean values, either True or False.
     5. list: For ordered collections of items.
     6. tuple: For ordered, immutable collections of items.
     7. dict: For unordered collections of key-value pairs.
     8. set: For unordered collections of unique items.

These concepts form the foundation of Python programming. Remember, variables help you store and manipulate data, and understanding data types is crucial for writing effective Python code.
